            <p>
                We can dance if we want to <br>
                We can leave your friends behind<br>
                'Cause your friends don't dance<br>
                And if they don't dance<br>
                Well, they're no friends of mine<br>
                <br>
                Say, we can go where we want to<br>
                A place where they will never find<br>
                And we can act like we come<br>
                From out of this world<br>
                Leave the real one far behind<br>
                <br>
                And we can dance<br>
                Or sing<br>
                <br>
                We can go when we want to<br>
                Night is young and so am I<br>
                And we can dress real neat<br>
                From our hats to our feet<br>
                And surprise 'em with the victory cry<br>
                <br>
                Say, we can act if we want to<br>
                If we don't, nobody will<br>
                And you can act real rude and totally removed<br>
                And I can act like an imbecile<br>
                <br>
                And say, we can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everything's out of control<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                They're doing it from pole to pole<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everybody look at your hands<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everybody's taking the chance<br>
                Safety dance<br>
                Oh well, the safety dance<br>
                Ah yes, the safety dance<br>
                <br>
                We can dance if we want to<br>
                We've got all your life and mine<br>
                As long as we abuse it, never gonna lose it<br>
                Everything'll work out right<br>
                <br>
                I say, we can dance if we want to<br>
                We can leave your friends behind<br>
                Because your friends don't dance<br>
                And if they don't dance<br>
                Well, they're no friends of mine<br>
                <br>
                I say, we can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everything's out of control<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                We're doing it from pole to pole<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everybody look at your hands<br>
                We can dance, we can dance<br>
                Everybody's taking the chance<br>
                <br>
                Oh well, the safety dance<br>
                Ah yes, the safety dance<br>
                Oh well, the safety dance<br>
                Oh well, the safety dance<br>
                Oh yes, the safety dance<br>
                Oh, the safety dance, yeah<br>
                Well, it's the safety dance<br>
                It's the safety dance<br>
                Well, it's the safety dance<br>
                Well, it's the safety dance<br>
                Oh, it's the safety dance<br>
                Oh, it's the safety dance<br>
