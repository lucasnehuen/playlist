            <p>
                Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night<br>
                Lookin' for the fight of her life<br>
                In the real-time world no one sees her at all<br>
                They all say she's crazy<br>
                <br>
                Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart<br>
                Changing movement into light<br>
                She has danced into the danger zone<br>
                When the dancer becomes the dance<br>
                <br>
                It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire<br>
                On a wire between will and what will be<br>
                <br>
                She's a maniac, maniac on the floor<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                She's a maniac, maniac on the floor<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                <br>
                On the ice-blue line of insanity is a place most never see<br>
                It's a hard-won place of mystery touch it, but can't hold it<br>
                You work all your life for that<br>
                Moment in time, it could come or pass you by<br>
                It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance<br>
                If the hunger stays the night<br>
                <br>
                There's a cold kinetic heat, struggling, stretching for the beat<br>
                Never stopping with her head against the wind<br>
                <br>
                She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                <br>
                It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire<br>
                On a wire between will and what will be<br>
                She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know)<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                Maniac, maniac, I sure know<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
                She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know)<br>
                And she's dancing like she's never danced before<br>
