                There's a loving in your eyes all the way<br>
                If I listen to your lies would you say<br>
                I'm a man without conviction<br>
                I'm a man who doesn't know<br>
                How to sell a contradiction<br>
                You come and go<br>
                You come and go<br>

                You come and go<br>
                Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dream<br>
                Red, gold and green<br>
                Red, gold and green<br>
                <br>
                Didn't hear your wicked words everyday<br>
                And you used to be so sweet I heard you say<br>
                That my love was an addiction<br>
                When we cling our love is stron<br>
                When you go you're gone forever<br>
                You string along<br>
                You string along<br>
                <br>
