        <div id="lyrics">
            <p>
                She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene<br>
                I said: Don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one<br>
                Who will dance on the floor in the round?<br>
                She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
                <br>
                She told me her name was Billie Jean<br>
                As she caused a scene<br>
                Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed<br>
                Of being the one<br>
                Who will dance on the floor in the round<br>
                <br>
                People always told me: Be careful of what you do<br>
                And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts<br>
                My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love<br>
                And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth<br>
                <br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
                But the kid is not my son<br>
                She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
                <br>
                For forty days and forty nights<br>
                The law was on her side<br>
                But who can stand when she's in demand<br>
                Her schemes and plans<br>
                'Cause we danced on the floor in the round<br>
                So take my strong advice<br>
                Just remember to always think twice<br>
                (Do think twice, do think twice)<br>
                <br>
                She told: My baby, we danced 'til three<br>
                Then she looked at me<br>
                Then showed a photo: My baby cried<br>
                His eyes were like mine<br>
                'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby<br>
                <br>
                People always told me: Be careful of what you do<br>
                And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts<br>
                But she came and stood right by me<br>
                Just to smell her sweet perfume<br>
                This happened much too soon<br>
                She called me to her room<br>
                <br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
                But the kid is not my son<br>
                <br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>

                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                She's just a girl who claims that I am the one<br>
                (No, she is not just my baby)<br>
                But the kid is not my son<br>
                <br>
                She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son<br>
                She says I am the one<br>
                (You know what you did)<br>
                She says he is my son<br>
                (Breaking my heart, babe)<br>
                She says I am the one<br>
                <br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                (Call me, Billie Jean)<br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
                (She is not at the scene)<br>
                <br>
                The Billie Jean is not my lover<br>
