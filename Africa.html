            <p>
                I hear the drums echoing tonight<br>
                But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation<br>
                She's coming in, 12:30 flight<br>
                <br>
                The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation<br>
                I stopped an old man along the way<br>
                Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies<br>
                He turned to me as if to say<br>
                "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"<br>
                <br>
                It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
                There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
                <br>
                The wild dogs cry out in the night<br>
                As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company<br>
                I know that I must do what's right<br>
                As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti<br>
                I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become<br>
                <br>
                It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
                There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
                <br>
                Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you<br>
                <br>
                It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
                There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                (I bless the rain)<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
                (Gonna take the time)<br>
                Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>
