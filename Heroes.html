            <p>
                I, I will be king<br>
                And you, you will be queen<br>
                Though nothing will drive them away<br>
                We can beat them, just for one day<br>
                We can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
                <br>
                And you, you can be mean<br>
                And I, I'll drink all the time<br>
                'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact<br>
                Yes we're lovers, and that is that<br>
                Though nothing, will keep us together<br>
                We could steal time, just for one day<br>
                We can be Heroes, for ever and ever<br>
                What'd you say?<br>
                <br>
                I, I wish you could swim<br>
                Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim<br>
                Though nothing<br>
                Nothing will keep us together<br>
                We can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
                Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
                <br>
                I, I will be king<br>
                And you, you will be queen<br>
                Though nothing will drive them away<br>
                We can be Heroes<br>
                Just for one day<br>
                We can be all us<br>
                Just for one day<br>
                <br>
                I, I can remember<br>
                (I remember)<br>
                Standing by the wall<br>
                (By the wall)<br>
                And the guns shot above our heads<br>
                (Over our heads)<br>
                And we kissed as though nothing could fall<br>
                (Nothing could fall)<br>
                And the shame<br>
                Was on the other side<br>
                Oh we can beat them<br>
                For ever and ever<br>
                Then we could be Heroes<br>
                Just for one day<br>
                <br>
                We can be Heroes<br>
                We can be Heroes<br>
                We can be Heroes<br>
                <br>
                We're nothing, and nothing will help us<br>
                Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay<br>
                But we could be safer, just for one day<br>
                Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day<br>
