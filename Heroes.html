            <p>
                I, I will be king
                And you, you will be queen
                Though nothing will drive them away
                We can beat them, just for one day
                We can be Heroes, just for one day
                <br>
                And you, you can be mean
                And I, I'll drink all the time
                'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
                Yes we're lovers, and that is that
                Though nothing, will keep us together
                We could steal time, just for one day
                We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
                What'd you say?
                I, I wish you could swim
                Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
                Though nothing
                Nothing will keep us together
                We can beat them, for ever and ever
                Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day
                I, I will be king
                And you, you will be queen
                Though nothing will drive them away
                We can be Heroes
                Just for one day
                We can be all us
                Just for one day
                I, I can remember
                (I remember)
                Standing by the wall
                (By the wall)
                And the guns shot above our heads
                (Over our heads)
                And we kissed as though nothing could fall
                (Nothing could fall)
                And the shame
                Was on the other side
                Oh we can beat them
                For ever and ever
                Then we could be Heroes
                Just for one day
                We can be Heroes
                We can be Heroes
                We can be Heroes
