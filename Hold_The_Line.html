                It's not in the way that you hold me<br>
                It's not in the way you say you care<br>
                It's not in the way you've been treating my friends<br>
                It's not in the way that you stayed till the end<br>
                It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do<br>
                <br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time, oh oh oh<br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time, oh oh oh<br>
                <br>    
                It's not in the words that you told me, girl<br>
                It's not in the way you say you're mine<br>
                It's not in the way that you came back to me<br>
                It's not in the way that your love set me free<br>
                It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do<br>
                <br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time, oh oh oh<br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time, oh oh oh<br>
                <br>
                It's not in the words that you told me<br>
                It's not in the way you say you're mine<br>
                It's not in the way that you came back to me<br>
                It's not in the way that your love set me free<br>
                It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do<br>
                <br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time, oh oh oh<br>
                Hold the line<br>

                Love isn't always on time<br>
                <br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time<br>
                Love isn't always, love isn't always on time<br>
                Hold the line<br>
                Love isn't always on time<br>
                Love isn't always on time<br>
