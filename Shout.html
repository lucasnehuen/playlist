                Shout, shout, let it all out<br>
                These are the things I can do without<br>
                Come on<br>
                I'm talking to you, come on<br>

                <br>
                In violent times<br>
                You shouldn't have to sell your soul<br>
                In black and white<br>
                They really, really ought to know<br>
                <br>
                Those one-track minds<br>
                That took you for a working boy<br>
                Kiss them goodbye<br>
                You shouldn't have to jump for joy<br>
                You shouldn't have to jump for joy<br>
                <br>
                Shout, shout, let it all out<br>
                These are the things I can do without<br>
                Come on<br>
                I'm talking to you, come on<br>
                <br>
                They gave you life<br>
                And in return, you gave them hell<br>
                As cold as ice<br>
                I hope we live to tell the tale<br>
                I hope we live to tell the tale<br>
