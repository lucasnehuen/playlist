        What I want, you've got<br>
        And it might be hard to handle<br>
        But like the flame that burns the candle<br>
        The candle feeds the flame<br>
        What I've got's full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter<br>
        You pull them all together<br>
        And how, I can't explain<br>
        <br>
        Well well you<br>
        You make my dreams come true<br>
        Well well well you<br>
        You make my dreams come true<br>
        <br>
        On a night when bad dreams become a screamer<br>
        When they're messin' with a dreamer<br>
        I can laugh it in the face<br>
        Twist and shout my way out<br>
        And wrap yourself around me<br>
        Cause I ain't the way that you found me<br>
        I'll never be same<br>
        Well cause you
        <br>
        You make my dreams come true<br>
        Well well well you<br>
        You make my dreams come true<br>
        Listen to this<br>
        <br>

        I'm down on my daydream<br>
        That sleepwalk should be over by now<br>
        I know<br>
        <br>

        Well you hell yeah<br>
        You make my dreams come<br>
        I've been waiting for waiting for you girl<br>
        Oh, yeah you make my dreams come true<br>
        Me you me and you<br>
        I've been waiting for waiting for you girl (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
        All my life<br>
        You make my dreams come true (you, you) whoa (you, you)<br>
        Whoa, whoa I've been<br>
        Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for<br>
        Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for<br>
        (You make my dreams) ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        I've been waiting for you girl (you, you, you, you)<br>
        (You make my dream you, you, you, you)<br>
